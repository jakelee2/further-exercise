/*
 * A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function’s variables—scope chain. 
   The closure has three scope chains: 
	   it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets), 
	   it has access to the outer function’s variables, and 
	   it has access to the global variables.
 *
 */
// A Basic Example of Closures in JavaScript:

	function showName(firstName, lastName) {
		var nameIntro = "Your name is ";
		
		// this inner function has access to the outer function's variables, including the parameters (access to firstName and lastName)
		function makeFullName(){
			return nameIntro + firstName + " " + lastName;
		}
		return makeFullName ();
	}
	console.log(showName ("Michael", "Jackson")); // Your name is Michael Jackson

	
	/*
	 * Closures’ Rules and Side Effects
	 *
	 * 1. Closures have access to the outer function’s variable even after the outer function returns:
	 */

	function celebrityName (firstName) {
		var nameIntro = "This celebrity is ";
	    // this inner function has access to the outer function's variables, including the parameter​
	   	function lastName (theLastName) {
			return nameIntro + firstName + " " + theLastName;
	    }
	    return lastName;
	}
	var showCelebName = celebrityName ("Michael"); // At this juncture, the celebrityName outer function has returned.​
//  var showCelebName = function lastName(theLastName){ return nameIntro + firstName + " " + theLastName; }
	
	// The closure (lastName) is called here after the outer function has returned above​
	// Yet, the closure still has access to the outer function's variables and parameter​
	console.log(showCelebName ("Jackson")); // This celebrity is Michael Jackson

	
	function add() {
	    var counter = 0;
	    function plus() {counter += 1;}
		plus();    //⇐ plus() function is call here
	    return counter; 
	}
	
	console.log(add());
	
	console.log("===================1");
/*
The self-invoking function only runs once. It sets the counter to zero (0), and returns a function expression.  
⇒ So it becomes like  it:  
var add1 = function () {return counter += 1;}   with counter value being 0. 
This way ‘add1’ becomes a function. The "wonderful" part is that it can access the counter in the parent scope.
This is called a JavaScript closure. It makes it possible for a function to have "private" variables.
The 'counter' is protected by the scope of the anonymous function, and can only be changed using the add function.
*/
	var add1 = (function () {
	    var counter = 0;	// counter is "private" variable
	    return function () {return counter += 1;}
	})();
	add1();
	add1();
	add1();
	console.log(add1());
	
	console.log("abcd: "+"abcd".includes(""));
	
	console.log("===================2  Closure ============");
/*
As you can see, a is now an object, with a method publicfunction ( a.publicfunction() ) which calls privatefunction, which only exists inside the closure. 
You can NOT call privatefunction directly (i.e. a.privatefunction() ), just publicfunction().

Its a minimal example but maybe you can see uses to it? We used this to enforce public/private methods.
*/
	var a = (function () {
	    var privatefunction = function () {
	        alert('hello private 111');
	        return 'hello 111';
	    }

	    var privatefunction2 = function () {
	        alert('hello private 222');
	    }

	    return {
	        publicfunction : function () {
	        	return privatefunction();

// https://javascript.info/promise-basics
// A promise is a special JavaScript object that links the “producing code” and the “consuming code” 
// together. In terms of our analogy: this is the “subscription list”. 
// The “producing code” takes whatever time it needs to produce the promised result, 
// and the “promise” makes that result available to all of the subscribed code when it’s ready.
