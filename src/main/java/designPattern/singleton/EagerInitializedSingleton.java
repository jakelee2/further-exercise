** Eager initialization
In eager initialization, the instance of Singleton Class is created at the time of class loading, 
this is the easiest method to create a singleton class but it has a drawback that 
instance is created even though client application might not be using it.

/*
If your singleton class is not using a lot of resources, this is the approach to use. 
But in most of the scenarios, Singleton classes are created for resources such as 
File System, Database connections etc and we should avoid the instantiation 
until unless client calls the getInstance method. 
Also this method doesnâ€™t provide any options for exception handling.
